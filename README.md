# Decentralised Petshop

## Description
Decentralised Petshop is a blockchain-based pet adoption platform built on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts. The project allows users to adopt pets and manage pet ownership in a decentralized, secure, and transparent way. The use of blockchain ensures that ownership records are tamper-proof and that transactions are secure.

The petshop leverages Solidity for smart contract development and integrates web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Web3.js for the front-end interface, making the platform user-friendly and accessible for anyone with an Ethereum wallet.
